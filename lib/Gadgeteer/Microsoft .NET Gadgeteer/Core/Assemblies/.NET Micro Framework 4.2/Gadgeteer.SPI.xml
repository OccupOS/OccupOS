            <summary>
             Represents a Microwire/Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) interface to communicate with a Microwire/SPI compatible device. 
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
             The Microwire/SPI interface is a synchronous serial communications protocol in which multiple devices 
             can be connected with one another by means of a single three-wire system. This three-wire system includes 
             the serial data in the input signal, the serial data out signal, and the serial clock. You must use an additional GPIO 
             pin as a chip select for each device that will communicate on the Microwire/SPI interface.
            </para>
            <para>
             There are both 8-bit and 16-bit modes of operation using the overloaded read and write methods that have 
             byte (8-bit) arguments or unsigned short (16-bit) arguments. Note that you can configure both 8-bit 
             and 16-bit devices and have them share the SPI interface.
