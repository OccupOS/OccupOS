It has been designed from the ground up to be abstracted from the hardware, so whether you already have sensor systems in place, or are exploring the possibilities for adding them, OccupOS remains cost-effective.\r\n\r\n### v.1.0.0\r\nWe've come a long way since starting the project and though the source code has been available from the start, it may have not been immediately clear how to build or deploy it in your own environment.\r\n\r\nWith our v1.0.0 release, we're happy to report that we now have detailed documentation on both [deployment](http://github.com/OccupOS/OccupOS/blob/master/README.md) and [contribution](http://github.com/OccupOS/OccupOS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n![OccupOS 1.0.0 Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dXoOSoi.png)\r\n\r\n### Current Hardware Support\r\nWe support a significant set of sensors by default, namely:\r\n* [FEZ Spider Mainboard](http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/269), with:\r\n  * [**WiFi RS21 Module**](http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/282)\r\n  * [LightSense Module](http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/336)\r\n* [Netduino Plus 2](http://www.netduino.com/netduinoplus2/specs.htm), with:\r\n  * [**Arduino WiFi Shield**](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield)\r\n  * [**RN-XV WiFly Module**](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10822)\r\n  * [EtherMania WeatherShield](http://www.ethermania.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=612&language=en)\r\n* [Microsoft Kinect](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/)\r\n\r\n*Note:* **Bold** devices are required to run their associated boards.\r\n\r\n### Flexible\r\nOne of OccupOS's key aims is hardware independence. If we don't already support your device, either let us know or submit a pull request - it's a breeze to add the functionality yourself.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOccupOS is maintained by:\r\n* Daniyar Kaliyev (@dkaliyev)\r\n* Jisang Choi (@7517choi)\r\n* Markus Padourek (@Globegitter)\r\n* Morrison Cole (@MorrisonCole)\r\n* Richy Davis (@RichyDavis)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEither get in touch with the maintainers above through GitHub, submit an [issue](https://github.com/OccupOS/OccupOS/issues) or send us an email (mail@occupos.org).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
