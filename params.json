{"name":"OccupOS","tagline":"Scalable, hardware agnostic environmental monitoring.","body":"![OccupOS Logo](http://i.imgur.com/o7go5Yj.png)\r\n\r\n### What is OccupOS?\r\nOccupOS is a complete software solution for environmental monitoring that has been designed from the ground up to be abstracted from the hardware. Whether you already have sensor systems in place, or are exploring the possibilities for adding them, OccupOS can improve your existing options by leaps and bounds. \r\n\r\nThe project is still in its early stages of development, but you can grab our code and test it in a real environment already. \r\n\r\n### Flexible\r\nOccupOS is not tied to any particular hardware. If we don't already support a device, you can implement our simple JSON interface and begin sending data from new sensors (we appreciate pull requests for any improvements you might make!).\r\n\r\n### Default Hardware Support\r\nWe do support a limited (but expanding) set of hardware by default, namely:\r\n* Netduino Pro (with Weather Shield and WiFi Shields).\r\n* Gadgeteer Spider Fez (with light sensor module).\r\n* Microsoft Kinect.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOccupOS is maintained by Morrison Cole (@MorrisonCole), Daniyar Kaliyev (@dkaliyev), Richy Davis (@RichyDavis), Markus Padourek (@Globegitter) and Jisang Choi (@7517choi).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEither get in touch with the maintainers above through GitHub, submit an [issue](https://github.com/OccupOS/OccupOS/issues) or send us an email (mail@occupos.org).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
